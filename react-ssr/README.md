# React SSR

This directory is a brief example of a [Fleet serverless function](https://fleetfn.com/function) that contains a function invoked via HTTP that renders a simple React application on the server.

## Deploy Your Own

If you are new here you can deploy your [serverless function](https://fleetfn.com/function) with Fleet:

- [Request early access](https://fleetfn.com/#request-early-access) to open your account
- Install [Fleet CLI](https://fleetfn.com/docs/fleet-cli.html)
- Create a new project

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:fleetfn/examples.git && cd examples/react-server-renderer
```

Now just deploy. Enjoy ðŸ˜‰!

```shell
$ fleet
```

You can now take the test using your browser.
