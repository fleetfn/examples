# React SSR

This directory is a brief example of a [Fleet serverless function](https://fleetfn.com/function) that contains a function invoked via HTTP that renders a simple React application on the server.

_Live Example: https://examples.runfleet.io/react-ssr/_

## Deploy Your Own

If you are new here you can deploy your [serverless function](https://fleetfn.com/function) with Fleet:

- Install [Fleet CLI](https://fleetfn.com/docs/fleet-cli.html)
- [Create a new project in Fleet Console](https://console.fleetfn.com/)

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:fleetfn/examples.git && cd examples/react-server-renderer
```

Now just deploy. Enjoy ðŸ˜‰!

```shell
$ fleet
```

You can now take the test using your browser.
